# Junior FrontEnd Test

You need to create a simple todo list application that can do the following:

- Add new todo list
- Increment any of the counters
- Decrement any of the counters
- Delete a todo list
- Show a sum of all the counter values

## notes
- The design, layout, ux, is all up to you.
- You can change anything you want (server stuff included) as long as the above list is completed.
- This isn't a backend test, don't make it require any databases.
- If you decide to use a precompiler of any kind (js/css/etc) we need to able to run it with ```npm run build```.
- Tests are good.
